## Insight

### A High-Quality Static Site Generator for the Modern Web

In today's digital landscape, speed is paramount. We sought a way to generate
static websites that are high-quality, accessible, and SEO-friendly. No existing
solution was able to meet our needs. Therefore, we created our own from the
ground up, aiming to provide a fast and reliable alternative to existing static
site generators.

## Idea

### A solution of infinite scalability and customisation


[**Shokunin â§‰**][00] is a blazing-fast static site generator (SSG) built with
[**Rust â§‰**][03]. Shokunin makes it simple and quick to generate websites that are
optimized for SEO and are fully compliant with accessibility standards.

We developed Shokunin to push the boundaries of what is possible. To ensure a
successful implementation, we also created a cohesive design system.

## Impact

### A new standard for static site generators

Generating a static website with Shokunin is effortless, allowing for a focus on
content that maximizes impact on the intended audience. The process is
straightforward and completes in milliseconds.

The resulting website, in turn, is fully responsive, compliant with the
[**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) â§‰**][01], [**ADA â§‰**][02], and
is optimised for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) from the outset.

The meticulous attention to detail makes Shokunin a new standard for static
site generators and a breakthrough in the field of web development.

## Incentives

combination of well thought out design, it empowers content creators and
creative professionals to enhance the customer-centric experience.

the essential. The result is a fast, secure, and reliable static site generator
that is easy to use and maintain.
