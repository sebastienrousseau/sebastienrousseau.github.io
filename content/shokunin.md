## Insight

### A High-Quality Static Site Generator for the Modern Web

In today's digital landscape, speed and quality are paramount. I was determined
to find a way to quickly generate static websites that showcase high quality,
accessibility, and SEO-friendliness.

Static websites are web pages that remain fixed and unchanging unless manually
updated. They consist of HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript files, offering
fast loading times and enhanced security compared to dynamic websites.

Unfortunately, no existing products met my requirements out of the box. As a
result, I took it upon myself to create a new solution from scratch. My goal was
to offer a fast and dependable alternative to the current static site generators
available in the market.

## Idea

### A Solution of Infinite Scalability and Customisation

I developed [**Shokunin â§‰**][00] with the aim of providing a lightning-fast
static site generator (SSG) built with [**Rust â§‰**][03] that streamlines the
process of creating static websites optimised for SEO and fully aligned with
accessibility standards.

I was eager to explore the boundaries of what I could do with
[**Markdown â§‰**][08]. My goal was to make sure the static website would be
speedy, secure, and dependable. I wanted it to be accessible to everyone,
user-friendly, and easy to update, and score well on search engines.

## Impact

### A New Standard for Static Site Generators

Generating a static website with Shokunin is effortless, allowing for a focus on
content that maximises impact on the intended audience. The process is
straightforward and completes in milliseconds.

As a result, the website is fully responsive, compliant with the
[**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) â§‰**][01], [**ADA â§‰**][02], and
is optimised for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) from the outset.

## Incentives

### Embracing a New Paradigm Requires Courage and Confidence

understanding the web. With its meticulously crafted design, it empowers content
creators and creative professionals to enhance the customer-centric experience.
