## Insight

### The payments industry is evolving, and ISO 20022 is leading the way

[**ISO 20022 ‚ßâ**][01] is a groundbreaking standard that is simplifying
transactions and enhancing payment systems worldwide. It provides a common
language for exchanging payment data, making payments more efficient and secure.

Banks, corporations, and financial institutions around the globe have adopted
ISO 20022, leveraging its power to automate and standardize payment transactions.
This is facilitating a smooth and efficient global financial ecosystem.

## Idea

### Pain001 is a Python library that simplifies the creation of ISO 20022-compliant payment messages

Recognising the complexity of ISO 20022, I developed and launched
[**Pain001 ‚ßâ**][00], an open-source toolset for creating, translating, and
validating payment initiation and advice messages. It follows the High Value
Payments Plus (HVPS+) and Cross-Border Payments and Reporting Plus (CBPR+)
standards.

Pain001 allows for direct creation of messages from CSV or SQLite databases,
which reduces processing costs, increases efficiency, and enhances accuracy.

## Impact

### Leverage the Power of ISO 20022 with Pain001

**Pain001** is committed to simplifying and streamlining the process of
generating payment messages, enabling easy adoption of ISO 20022 and
facilitating seamless integration with existing systems to achieve ISO 20022
compliance.

Pain001 can significantly mitigate processing costs and complexities by
eliminating the need for manual data entry and file generation. It can also help
to reduce the risk of errors, which can further reduce costs.

For organisations looking to simplify and automate their payment processing,
**Pain001** serves as a practical and highly effective solution.
