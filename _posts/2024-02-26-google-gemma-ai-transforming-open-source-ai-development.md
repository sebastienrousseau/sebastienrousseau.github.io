## Integrating Google Gemma with Ollama on macOS

[**Ollama ⧉**][02] is an interface that enables exploring AI assistants locally on a macOS system. We'll use it to set up Gemma 2B and 7B models on Apple's M series computers. This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Gemma with Ollama on macOS.

You can use the uname command to print the processor architecture of the computer. Open Terminal and run:

```bash
uname -m
```

If the output is `arm64`, you have an M series Mac. If it's `x86_64`, you have an Intel Mac. This guide is for M series Macs.

### Setting up the Environment

#### 1. Make sure Python 3.8+, pip, venv are installed

Before getting started, ensure you have [**Python 3.8 ⧉**][04] or greater set up on your Mac, as well as `pip` and `venv` tools. You can check your Python and pip versions and upgrade pip running the following commands in Terminal:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies

Open Terminal and create a virtual env to prevent conflicts with system-wide packages.

```bash
python3 -m venv gemma_env
source gemma_env/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install the latest Ollama for macOS

Download the [**latest Ollama ⧉**][05] for macOS from the official website. Extract and move the Ollama app to your Applications folder. Open it and follow the setup instructions.

#### 4. Confirm Ollama install was successful

Check if Ollama is correctly installed by running:

```bash
ollama --version
```

You should see the version of Ollama printed out.

### System Recommendations

For optimal Gemma 2B performance, you'll need:

- **Processor**: Multi-core Intel i5 or greater
- **Memory**: 16GB RAM (32GB for Gemma 7B)
- **Storage**: 50GB free space SSD
- **macOS**: Up-to-date (Monterey or later)

With Ollama's set up, you're ready to initialise and interact with Gemma's models locally.

![divider][divider].class=\"m-10 w-100\"

## Initialising Local Gemma Instance

### 1. Launch Gemma model via Ollama CLI

Choose the Gemma model you wish to run:

- Gemma 2B (smaller model): `ollama run gemma:2b`
- Gemma 7B (larger model): `ollama run gemma:7b`

### 2. First run will download model assets (may take time)

The first run will download the selected Gemma model, which may take some time. Once finished, Gemma will initialise for use.

#### Sample Conversational Query

```bash
>>> Hello Gemma. How are you today?
```

Gemma will respond with a natural language reply.

```bash
>>> Hello Gemma. How are you today?
Hello! It's a lovely day to be alive. Thank you for asking. How are you doing today? 😊
```

### Deactivate Virtual Environment

```bash
deactivate
```

This will revert to your system's default Python environment.
