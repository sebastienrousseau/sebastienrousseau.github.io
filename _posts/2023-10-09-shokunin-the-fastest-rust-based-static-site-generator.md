## Insight

### A High-Quality Static Site Generator for the Modern Web

In the ever-evolving digital landscape, speed and quality are of paramount importance. I was determined to find a way to quickly generate static websites that showcase high quality, accessibility, and SEO-friendliness.

Static websites are web pages that remain fixed and unchanging unless manually updated. They consist of HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript files, offering fast loading times and enhanced security compared to dynamic websites.

Unfortunately, no existing products met my requirements out of the box. Therefore, I took it upon myself to create a new solution from scratch. My goal was to offer a fast and reliable alternative to the current static site generators available in the market and to push the limits of what was possible with Rust.

## Idea

### A Solution of Infinite Scalability and Customisation

I developed [**Shokunin ‚ßâ**][00] with the aim of providing a lightning-fast static site generator (SSG) built with [**Rust ‚ßâ**][03] that streamlines the process of creating static websites optimised for SEO and fully aligned with accessibility standards.

Speed and reliability were my top priorities when developing Shokunin. Rust is a systems programming language that is known for its speed and reliability, making it ideal for developing high-performance static site generators.

I was eager to explore the boundaries of what I could do with Markdown. My goal was to make sure that Shokunin could generate static websites that are speedy, secure, and dependable. I wanted them to be accessible to everyone, user-friendly and easy to update, and score well on search engines.
