[![DateTime (DTT), Your Essential Toolkit for Date and Time Operations](https://kura.pro/dtt/images/github/github-dtt.webp).class=\"img-fluid clearfix\"][01]

## Efficient Date and Time Management with DateTime (DTT)

In the realm of software development, effectively managing dates and times is a common challenge. `DateTime (DTT)` emerges as a Rust library meticulously crafted to streamline this process, rendering it seamless and straightforward.

![divider][divider].class=\"m-10 w-100\"

## What is DTT?

`DateTime (DTT)` stands as an open-source Rust library, meticulously designed to simplify the way you interact with dates and times. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting date and time data. DTT's development prioritizes performance, accuracy, and ease of integration, making it an ideal choice for modern software development projects.

![divider][divider].class=\"m-10 w-100\"

## Features

DTT boasts an array of features that empower developers to effortlessly manage dates and times:

1. **Parsing**: DTT seamlessly interprets dates and times from various string formats, converting them into a Rust-friendly structure.
2. **Validating**: DTT's robust validation capabilities provide the accuracy of your date and time data, preventing common errors and inconsistencies.
3. **Manipulating**: DTT provides easy methods for changing date and time data. This includes adding days, comparing times, and more.
4. **Formatting**: DTT offers customizable formatting options to present dates and times in a user-friendly format, catering to your application's specific needs.

## Getting Started with DTT

To begin using DTT in your Rust projects, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Rust**: To install DTT, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on your computer. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the instructions on the Rust website.

2. **Install DTT**: Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install DTT using the following command:

```bash
cargo install dtt
```

3. **Add DTT dependency to your project**: Add the following line to your Cargo.toml file to install the DateTime (DTT) library.

```toml
[dependencies]
dtt = "0.0.4"
```

4. **Use DTT**: Once installed, import the DateTime (DTT) library into your Rust code using the following statement.

```rust
use dtt::DateTime;
```

5. **Start using DTT**: With DTT imported, you can now start utilising its extensive features to manage dates and times in your Rust projects.

Here's an example of creating a new DateTime object with a custom timezone (e.g., CEST):

```rust
use dtt::DateTime;
use dtt::dtt_print;

fn main() {
    // Create a new DateTime object with a custom timezone (e.g., CEST)
    let paris_time = DateTime::new_with_tz("CEST");
    dtt_print!(paris_time);
}
```
